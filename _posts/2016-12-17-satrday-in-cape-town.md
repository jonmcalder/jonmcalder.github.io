In just two months time, the [second satRday](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org) will be 
taking place right on my doorstep, in Cape Town, South Africa. I keep telling 
people I am looking forward to it, but to be honest that's really quite an 
understatement. I am super excited!

If you don't know what [satRdays](http://satrdays.org/) are about, here is the 
back story...

In early-mid 2015, [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke) got 
conversation going around the possibility of a [SQLSaturday-inspired R conference](http://itsalocke.com/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r) after raising the idea 
at [EARL 2015 Boston](https://earlconf.com/boston/). With fantastic support from 
the `#rstats` community, [a proposal](https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal) 
was developed and later submitted to the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org) 
in January 2016. 

In March 2016, the R Consortium [announced their support for satRdays](https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2016/03/23/r-consortium-funds-technical-initiatives-community-events-and-training-to-support-r-user-community), with three 
events to be hosted initially, and plans for additional meet-ups as the R user 
base grows. Multiple locations were suggested for the first three satRdays and the agreed 
upon strategy was to host one in Eastern Europe, one in North America, and one 
on another continent elsewhere in the world.

Having been involved with the project early on, [Gergely Dar√≥czi](https://about.me/daroczig) 
agreed to organise the first satRday in Budapest. More than 2000 people from the 
online community [voted on where the next two satRday events should take place](https://app.doopoll.co/poll/ZznsEGPnmbFafim2c/live-results), and Puerto 
Rico and Cape Town claimed the most votes for North America and the rest of the 
world.

The first satRday took place in Budapest on the 3rd September 2016 and was [a big success](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2016/09/07/the-start-of-satrdays), 
with almost 200 people from 19 countries registering for the event. The 
conference delegates comprised of a good mix of R enthusiasts from both industry 
and academia, who were treated to high quality workshops as well as invited 
and contributed talks from 25 local and international speakers.

So that brings us to the present, with preparations for [Cape 
Town satRday](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org) already well under way. The conference 
will take place on the 18th February 2017, and the venue is [Workshop 17](http://workshop17.co.za/), located in the heart of Cape Town's beautiful V&A 
Waterfront.

Keynote speakers [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke), 
[Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) and [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) 
will be conducting workshops on the 16th & 17th February, covering the building 
and validation of logistic regression models, the intersection of R, Git & 
Github, and the development of reactive web apps with Shiny [(you can find further workshop details here)](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/#workshops).
