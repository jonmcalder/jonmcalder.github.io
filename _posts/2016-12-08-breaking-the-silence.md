In April of 2016, I made a new friend. His name is 
[Lorenz](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/) and he is from Switzerland. We met 
one evening when I arrived to pick him up for a small church group meeting, and 
he ambled up to the driver side door only to be reminded - by my presence in the 
drivers seat - that South Africa is not part of the two thirds of the world's 
population that drive on the right hand side of the road. Anyway, I believe it 
was while chatting on our way home later that evening that he first mentioned R 
and that immediately took our budding friendship to the next level :-)

He had made his way over here to South Africa to undergo a 3 month internship, 
partnering with the 
[Community Organisation Resource Centre (CORC)](http://sasdialliance.org.za/about/corc/) 
and [Shack / Slum Dwellers International (SDI)](http://knowyourcity.info/who-is-sdi/about-us/)
to collect and analyse data on informal settlements in the Cape Flats. During 
the course of his stay in Cape Town, we squeezed in occassional chats about 
`#rstats` in addition to the odd email back and forth. We also ventured out to 
the local [R User Group](https://caperuser.wordpress.com/) meetup on one occassion 
to hear from the legendary [Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/).

Mutually encouraged by our passion for R and statistics, our friendship 
blossomed quickly and we exchanged thoughts on various topics, but never really 
progressed beyond just talking about things, and the time soon came when Lorenz 
was due to move on to Kenya to continue with another internship there. So we 
said our goodbyes with the hope of being able to reconnect (somewhere) one day, 
and that was that.

And then one day towards the end of August, completely out of the blue, Lorenz 
shared this meme with me via e-mail:  

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
![Austin Powers Meme](/img/small-imgs/Austin_Powers.jpg "Austin Powers Meme - committing directly to master...")
</div>

Ironically, at that point in time my 3 year old GitHub account was effectively 
lying dormant, with a history of 1, 9, and 4 contributions in 2013, 2014 and 
2015 respectively, and a majestic 0 contributions for 2016. Anyway, we quickly 
struck up a conversation over email to catch up, and before long, he directed my 
attention towards a Github repo he had created, which amongst other things 
outlined some early ideas for an R package. He invited me to collaborate, and 
somehow just 3 days later I found myself active on Github.

Over the 3 month period since then, I have notched up 275 Github contributions, 
ranging from early progress on collaborative projects with Lorenz, to a few 
personal projects, branching out to a number of issues and pull requests on R 
packages and books from other authors, and ultimately to this blog itself. It 
has been really rewarding to start getting a little more active in the R 
community and of course to learn and grow in doing so. I was first introduced to 
R at university in 2005 - so in hindsight it really shouldn't have taken me so 
long to get to this stage. Clearly Lorenz was the catalyst I needed to get me 
going, so I am really grateful to him for that.

So when did Lorenz start using R? Almost 2 years ago now, he tells me. Take a bow son!
